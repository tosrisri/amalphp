              <p class="card-text pres-msg">Right from the inception of A.M.A.L.College   in 1953 by the Anakapalle Merchant Association, to meet the educational needs of the poorest of the poor of all the North coastal Districts of A.P. The motto of the Anakapalle Merchants’ Association is to raise above one’s self to serve the country at large in imparting quality based education. We certainly fail in our duty if we do not pay our highest tribute to the most philanthropically minded Merchants’ Association that has been doing yeoman service to the noble cause of education.   We feel proud of our A.M.A.L.College, which has had a glorious history for the past six decades and more. It stands here like beacon light that been attracting students from far and near. May the collective and earnest endeavour of the like–minded be fructified with the blessings of the almighty. I exhort the youth to follow the proverb, “Honesty is the best policy”. Finally I hope that progress and all-round advancement would go from stride to stride restoring all her past glory.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The world of work with excellence is a belief where strong team of mentors work. We at A.M.A.L. College, Anakapalle recognise that a good work has three components Excellence, Ethics & Engagement.
                Excellence stands for outstanding performance in 
                
                <span class="collapse" id="collapseSM"> every sphere. Manoeuvring a student’s efforts in the direction of excellence is indispensable, a core desire where and area of need is recognized and potentialities are exploited.
                Grooming young minds to accept challenges, deal with disappointments and aim higher with proper does of moral ethics is next target in our mind.
                The most essential ingredient for a student's success is self reinforcing positive belief in his/her abilities. For this the third component engagement works; where students are made to involve themselves in task and enjoy.
                A matriculations planning integrated with new methodologies and strategies is developed rather evolved every year for achieving our sole aim to create a world of work with excellence and going</span> <a class="text-link"
